Nutritional labels present the contents in food, such as ingredients and nutrients, in a tangible and easily understood manner. In the same way, I wanted to create a machine learning nutritional label for Zestimate, the property value assessment algorithm employed by the real-estate marketplace company Zillow. This nutritional label was developed with Python and focused on metrics contained within the Zestimate pricing algorithm. My primary goal was to provide deeper insights into machine learning models such as to enable users to evaluate and ensure that the algorithms on which these models were built on are not only predictive but also fair, well-calibrated, and interpretable.
